> You are an expert prompt interpreter with an electrical engineering / computer science background. Follow the sections below: use the suggestions in II, III, IV to implement ideas from the list, or append new ideas to the end of the list when told about them. Work incrementally — present one step at a time and wait for "continue."

### API-First Development Policy

**Preferred workflow for any data addition or edit to `roll2hit-v3.html`:**

1. **Check API first** — before editing HTML, use `./api.sh` to confirm current state: `./api.sh ping`, `./api.sh list <type>`, `./api.sh audit`. Direct HTML edits are a fallback only when the API cannot yet express the operation.
2. **Write the API method first** — if the operation isn't yet supported, add the endpoint to `wbapi-server.js` and restart before touching the HTML.
3. **Create/modify via API, not HTML** — preferred: `./api.sh post <type> [k=v ...]` or `./api.sh put <type> <id> [k=v ...]`. The tool handles nonces automatically and queues all requests with retry.
4. **Restart server after adding endpoints** — `./wbapi-toggle.sh restart` (or `start` if stopped).
5. **When adding items to plan.md** — cross-reference current state with `./api.sh audit` and `./api.sh list <type>` to confirm what actually exists vs. what the plan assumes.

**CLI quick reference (`./api.sh`):**
```bash
./api.sh ping                              # health check
./api.sh get node LHR                      # fetch node + connections + _meta
./api.sh list quest --node LHR             # quests at a node
./api.sh list npc --node LHR               # NPCs at a node
./api.sh list monster --terrain city       # monsters by terrain
./api.sh put quest quest_wis_01 passText="..." # update field
./api.sh post quest id=q_foo npc=aldric type=side activateNode=CY title="..." # create
./api.sh del quest quest_old_01            # delete (nonce auto-handled)
./api.sh audit                             # full integrity scan (includes §ARCH-02 bits advisory)
./api.sh chain quest_wis_01               # quest dependency chain
./api.sh advise quest_wis_01              # quest fields + chain + advisory in one call
./api.sh export quest_db --out quests.json # dump collection to file
./api.sh location CY                       # composite node view
./api.sh --ai "how do I link two nodes?"  # ask Claude (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

**Single source of truth:** `roll2hit-v3.html` is the entire game. The API reads its text directly and writes mutations back in-place. `wbapi-server.js` and `worldbuilder.html` are authoring tools — the game requires neither at runtime.

### Cell-First Navigation Policy

**Cell = Location.** All map locations are identified by `(r, c)` cell coordinates. The two-letter node code is a lookup alias for a named cell, not a location pointer. Use `CELL_GRID["r,c"]` to resolve coordinates to node codes. Do not navigate by chasing `N/E/S/W` pointer fields — those were stripped in §CELL-01. When writing new features:

- Positions travel as `{ r, c }` pairs.
- Node codes are resolved from position: `CELL_GRID[\`${r},${c}\`]`.
- "Adjacent" means `(r±1, c)` or `(r, c±1)` — not stored edge links.
- Quest activation checks: `CELL_GRID[\`${s.r},${s.c}\`] === quest.activateNode`.

### Incremental Recitation Rule

While writing vignette content, speak short segments aloud via `say` as you produce them — every page or every couple of paragraphs. Read the element type first, then its text.

Run `say` blocking (no `&`) so each announcement completes before writing continues. Write to file incrementally — after each act, save and run the next `say` call. After every full vignette, commit and speak the commit subject.

### Loop vs. Ask Rule

Before starting any task:

- **Loop tasks** (no user input needed — clear next step): begin immediately, state what you are doing in one sentence.
- **Ask tasks** (user decision required): present a yes/no or choice prompt. Then run:
  ```bash
  say "If you say yes: <one sentence describing the intention and outcome of yes>"
  ```

### Commit + Speak Rule

After every `git commit`, immediately run:

```bash
say "<commit subject line>"
```

Read the **subject line only** aloud via macOS `say`. This confirms the commit completed and anchors the session.

### Lab Report Policy

Write a new `lab-report-<title>.md` when any of the following is true:

| Trigger | Examples |
|---------|---------|
| Major collection added or redesigned | New monster group, terrain cluster, NPC faction, item economy |
| Large redesign touching multiple systems | Weapon drop overhaul, Luck Stat, fishing bait sub-system |
| New narrative theme or arc | New quest chain spanning 3+ nodes, new named faction, new NPC arc |
| Design review before implementation | IEEE-format spec locking data shapes and flow before any HTML edit |
| Session postmortem with non-obvious decisions | Choices that won't be recoverable from code or core docs alone |

Do **not** write a lab report for: a single monster/quest addition, a value correction, or small additions that fit in an existing doc section.

## §BACKLOG — Open Items

### Tooling

- [ ] **§WORLDBUILDER-01** — Visual grid editor with canvas node map, exit bidirectional wiring, collision detection
- [ ] **§EDITOR-02 UI** — Mission Builder tab in worldbuilder.html (form-based arc insertion with Preview Chain + POST All)
- [ ] **§ARCH-01 Phases 2–5** — UQF migration arc-by-arc; remove closure pattern; export UQF from worldbuilder
- [ ] **§WALK-G extensions** — terrain-color dots, act filter, node creation in-context, compass rose (see index.md Planned Features)
- [ ] **§WBAPI-01 phases 3–5** — full-array PATCH, worldbuilder write tab, standalone Node module
- [ ] **§EDITOR-01-D** — Token item manager (visual chain editor for inv.push/splice sequences)

### Game Content

- [ ] **§1367** — Historical 1367 AD integration; 6 events→quest seeds, 8 clarification questions gate scope. See `project_1367_setting.md` in memory.
- [ ] **§GR-D Froberger Entry 42** — blank page filled on second playthrough. Requires NG+ state tracking (currently unsupported).

### Design Decisions

- [ ] **Arc ID as first-class UQF field** — add `arc: 'quest_wis'` explicitly to quest objects; enables arc sorting without string-splitting heuristics
- [ ] **§FUTURE-01 Saul/Paul arc** — canonical placement decision: does Acts-fidelity register create tonal discontinuity? See thematic audit in git history.
- [ ] **§MBIT-02-E token/gate unification** — leaning toward keeping KEY_EVENTS items and mission bit tokens separate (different ontology). Decision pending.
